# 🎨 Color Object Detection using OpenCV + Gradio

This project demonstrates how to detect **Red, Green, and Blue objects** in images using **OpenCV**.  
It includes a **Gradio-based interactive frontend**, making it super easy to try out directly in **Google Colab**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Detect **Red, Green, and Blue** objects with bounding boxes.
- Choose between **single-color detection** or **all colors** combined.
- **Gradio UI** for a clean and interactive interface.
- Ready-to-run in **Google Colab** (no setup hassle).
- Upload an image or take a snapshot with your webcam 📸.
